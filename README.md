# FIrstHtmlCssProject
This is my first HTML CSS project .Clone of landing page of StackOverflow.
### Tech used:
1. HTML
2. Tailwindcss.

## Steps:
1. Fork it.
2. Clone it.
3. Go to *FIrstHtmlCssProject/build/index.html* and hit enter to see the page.

## Things not to expect:
1. Animations- as many animations are javascript based, and I dont know javascript yet.
2. Links-all links will take you to top.
3. Responsive , dark mode-didn't add responsiveness and dark mode because I will add it in a project where I will use html,tailwindcss, javascript,***also did not wanted to spend a lot of time in html,css and will spend a lot of time learning javascript.***

    ***(Its very easy to make a site responsive with tailwindcss's help ,just have to start building for smaller screens and then add breakpoints and then build for             bigger screens and same for dark mode just have to add dark:attributes .)***

4.aria- didn't added aria labels,as i realized this and learnt in middle of project and I was lazy.

## Motivation behind building this page
1. Wanted to apply my html,tailwindcss knowledge before heading for javascript.
